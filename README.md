Pymaceutical analysis with visualizations using python library matplotlib.

Utilized a dataset that contained the results of a anti-cancer pharmaceutical. The data showed 249 mice that were identified with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured.  The purpose of the study was to compare performance of Capomulin vs other treatment regimens. 

Before visualizations and calculations were made I had to clean the data and look for any duplicate counts.  There was one duplicate mouse discover and removed from the dataset.  

The visualizations and calculations made to show the performance of the drug are follows:

-Generated a summary statistic dashboard that contains mean, median, variance, standard deviation, standard error mean (SEM) of the tumor volumen for each drug regimen.

-Generated a bar plot that displays the number of total mice for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study.

-Generated a pie plot that shows the distribution of female or male mice 

-Calculated the final tumor volume of each mouse across the four most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Also, calculated the quartiles and inter quartile range to determine if there are any potential outliers across the four treatment regimens.

-Generated a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volumne for all four treatment regimens and highlighted any potential outliers.

-Selected a singular mouse that was treated with Capomulin and generated a line plot of tumor volumne vs. time point for that mouse.

-Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volumne for the Capolumlin treatment. 

-Finally there is a document that shows three observations made from visualizations and calculations.
